# Austin Curtis WEbsite

This was built off of the Vercel example for an image gallery site using Next.js, [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). I chose it because I like NextJS and was already using Cloudinary. Win-win.

# Local Dev

```
npm run dev
```

# Deploy

Automatically deploys to Vercel, which is hooked up to auss.io, on merge to main.
